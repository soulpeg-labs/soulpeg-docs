# Audit Status

As of now, the SoulPeg smart contracts have not undergone a formal third-party audit due to limited funding during the early development phase.

## AI-Assisted Code Review

Instead of relying solely on unaudited code, the protocol was extensively reviewed with the assistance of advanced AI models trained on smart contract security, Solidity best practices, and vulnerability detection. Each contract component was validated for:

- Reentrancy risks
- Access control logic
- Token transfer constraints
- Arithmetic precision
- Lock enforcement and bypass prevention

The AI-assisted audit process helped proactively identify and correct common security pitfalls and architectural flaws. While not a full substitute for a formal audit, this method has proven to be more rigorous and consistent than many superficial human audits in the space.

## Audit Plans

A professional audit is planned once the protocol achieves sufficient adoption or receives grant funding. When completed, audit reports will be published publicly and linked on this page.

## Summary

SoulPeg was built with a security-first mindset. While a traditional audit is not yet complete, the protocol's design has already passed multiple stages of AI-driven review and analysis. Users should exercise caution as with any unaudited protocol, and are encouraged to review the open-source contracts available on-chain.
