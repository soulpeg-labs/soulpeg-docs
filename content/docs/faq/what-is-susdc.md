sUSDC is a soul-bound stablecoin minted by the SoulPeg protocol in exchange for standard USDC deposits. It is pegged 1:1 with USDC and designed to serve as a non-transferable yield-bearing token on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).

Unlike traditional stablecoins, sUSDC cannot be transferred freely between wallets. Once minted, it is permanently tied to the wallet that received it unless explicitly unlocked after a designated lock period.

## Purpose

The primary function of sUSDC is to provide a secure and transparent way to earn sustainable yield without exposing users to typical DeFi risks such as flash loan exploits or liquidity manipulation. It is a passive, non-speculative staking asset.

## Key Characteristics

- **Pegged to USDC (1:1)**
- **Non-transferable while locked**
- **Yield-bearing**
- **Minted via deposits, rewarded via protocol-controlled distribution**
- **Requires explicit unlock after time-based lock expires**

sUSDC exists solely within the SoulPeg ecosystem and reflects a staked position. It is not intended for general-purpose use or external liquidity trading, but rather as a trusted proof of stake participation.
