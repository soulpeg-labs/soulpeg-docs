# Why Soulbound?

Soul-bound tokens are assets that cannot be transferred between wallets unless specific conditions are met. In the case of sUSDC, this design is central to the SoulPeg protocol’s mission of building a secure, manipulation-resistant staking environment.

## Eliminate Speculation

By preventing transfers, sUSDC removes the possibility of secondary market speculation, pump-and-dump behavior, or token flipping. This reinforces the protocol’s long-term yield-oriented purpose and protects stakers from external market volatility.

## Strengthen Security

Transferability introduces complexity—and potential vulnerabilities—especially when flash loans and automated arbitrage bots are involved. By making sUSDC non-transferable while locked, SoulPeg neutralizes entire classes of exploits, particularly those based on speed and composability.

## Enforce Commitment

Staking is most effective when it reflects user commitment. Soul-bound tokens create a strong bond between the user and their staked position. There’s no exit without completing the lock or explicitly calling for an early redeem through the protocol.

## Accurate Attribution

Rewards in SoulPeg are distributed based on address-level balances. If tokens were transferable, rewards could be gamed by transferring tokens between addresses before snapshots or distribution events. Soul-bound logic ensures rewards go only to actual, committed participants.

## Simplify Governance

For any future voting, delegation, or reputation mechanics, it is vital to know that a token reflects a real participant rather than a transient holder. Soul-bound staking makes it easier to build fair and durable governance models.

## Summary

Soul-bound design is not a limitation—it’s a feature that empowers security, trust, and clarity. It reinforces staking integrity, aligns incentives, and prevents abuse by ensuring that value stays bound to the actor who earned it.
