# Key Features

## Soulbound Tokens

sUSDC tokens are non-transferable and permanently linked to the wallet that minted them:
- Cannot be transferred or traded
- Eliminates speculative trading behavior
- Reinforces long-term staking commitment
- Enables accurate and fair reward attribution

## Flash-Loan Resistance

Designed to neutralize flash loan-based exploits:
- No borrowing-returning cycles can exploit the system
- Protects the protocolâ€™s yield pools from manipulation
- Secures the integrity of user rewards

## Sustainable Yield

Yield generation is driven by real, non-inflationary mechanisms:
- Yield is distributed via on-chain reward minting functions controlled by the protocol.
- Collected protocol fees
- Strategic integrations and partnerships
- No token emissions or artificial APYs
- Transparent, auditable reward model

## Security-Centric Architecture

Built with a layered security model to minimize risk:
- Smart contracts are independently audited
- Treasury governed by multisig protocols
- Upgrade mechanisms are time-locked
- Emergency circuit breakers available

## Transparent Protocol Mechanics

All economic and technical operations are public and verifiable:
- Real-time data on TVL, yield distribution, and reserves
- Clear tracking of protocol revenue and fee allocation
- Open governance logic (if applicable)
