# What is SoulPeg?

SoulPeg is a decentralized staking protocol designed to introduce a new category of stable assets on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), known as **soul-bound stablecoins (sUSDC)**. Unlike traditional stablecoins, sUSDC tokens are non-transferable and permanently linked to the wallet that minted them. This soul-bound design prevents the use of these tokens in flash loan exploits or other high-frequency attacks, improving protocol-level security.

SoulPeg is engineered for simplicity, safety, and sustainability. Users authorize the protocol to transfer their USDC, and the protocol mints an equal amount of sUSDC to their wallet. While sUSDC cannot be moved between wallets, it continuously accrues yield over time. This yield is distributed through a transparent and fair mechanism to every sUSDC holder, proportionate to their stake.

The protocol introduces a permissionless, contract-based approach to yield farmingâ€”eliminating common points of failure in traditional staking models. With a focus on risk minimization and passive income generation, SoulPeg aims to serve as a secure yield layer for DeFi users looking for long-term, reliable returns.

## Core Concept

When you deposit USDC into SoulPeg:
1. You receive sUSDC tokens (soul-bound)
2. Your sUSDC earns yield automatically
3. Rewards are distributed fairly among all holders
4. No risk of flash loan attacks

## Mission

Our mission is to create a secure, transparent, and sustainable yield generation mechanism for the DeFi community, eliminating common vulnerabilities found in traditional protocols.

## Built on BSC

SoulPeg is deployed on Binance Smart Chain, offering:
- Low transaction fees
- Fast confirmation times
- Wide ecosystem support
- Easy integration with existing DeFi protocols
