# Abstract

SoulPeg is a decentralized staking protocol designed to issue a new category of stable digital assets—soul-bound yield-bearing tokens—on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). The system centers around sUSDC, a non-transferable token minted 1:1 from standard USDC deposits and bound permanently to the originating wallet.

Unlike traditional staking platforms, SoulPeg enforces time-based locking per address, requires explicit manual unlocking, and eliminates token transferability during the lock period. This architecture removes entire classes of exploits common in DeFi, including flash loan attacks and recursive yield farming, while also reinforcing the connection between the staker and their position.

Rewards are distributed through on-chain governance-controlled minting, rather than automatic emissions. All economic activity is transparent, bounded by protocol-enforced rate limits, and governed via multisig.

SoulPeg is not intended as a general-purpose liquidity protocol. It is designed as a secure, trust-minimized staking foundation for long-term yield generation with built-in resistance to composability-based attacks.
