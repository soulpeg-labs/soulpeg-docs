# Roadmap

SoulPeg will follow a phased rollout approach to ensure controlled deployment, real-world feedback, and gradual decentralization. The project prioritizes transparency, safety, and protocol maturity over rapid expansion.

## June 2025 — Genesis Deployment

- Deploy SoulPeg smart contract to Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
- Mint and unlock initial sUSDC for liquidity provisioning (e.g. PancakeSwap)
- Launch documentation site and whitepaper
- Enable `depositAndMint()` and `rewardMint()` under multisig control
- Launch beta version with limited capacity

## June–July 2025 — Beta Phase

- Onboard early users and partners
- Monitor deposit volume, reward flows, and protocol metrics
- Evaluate gas efficiency and UX performance
- Begin third-party integration planning (explorers, dashboards, The Graph)

## Q3 2025 — Public Launch

- Remove beta gating and open protocol to all users
- Expand staking access with frontend UI and analytics
- Publish detailed audit plan and potentially initiate audit engagement
- Begin community growth and liquidity incentive pilots (if applicable)

## Q4 2025 — Cross-Chain Expansion (Tentative)

- Research and evaluate feasibility of deployment to additional chains (e.g. Arbitrum, Polygon)
- Adapt token decimals if required for non-18-decimal USDC environments
- Design interchain messaging or mirror staking if warranted

## 2026 and Beyond

- Explore DAO governance transition
- Introduce optional real-yield reward mechanisms (e.g. USDC staking strategies)
- Integrate analytics dashboards and community analytics tools
- Strengthen developer documentation and SDK support
